# Karatsuba Multiplication

## Description
This program multiplies two number faster than naive multipication which takes O(n<sup>2</sup>).
Includes the version with dynamic programming in Karatsuba-Multiplication-Dynamic-Programming.ipynb
and shows the speed difference between the recursive only versions and the dynamic programming version.
 
## Use
Multiplication of two numbers. 

## Run Time Complexity
O(n<sup>1.585</sup>)
